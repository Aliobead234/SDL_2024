# SDL(C)
## The purpose of this Repiratory:
In this repository, there will be located the solutions/answers of the problems that are given in the course of the "Software Dev Life cycle".
### Definition (General):
  The Software Development Life Cycle (SDL) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality, low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time. Its primary goal is to produce software that meets and exceeds all customer expectations and demands. The SDL defines and outlines a detailed plan with stages, or phases, that each encompass their own process and deliverables. Adherence to the SDL enhances development speed and minimizes project risks and costs associated with alternative methods of production

### The SDL stages:
  The SDLC includes several key stages such as:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: This is the initial stage where the client's requirements are gathered and documented.
2. **Design**: During this stage, the system design is done according to the requirements gathered in the previous stage.
3. **Implementation**: In this stage, the actual coding takes place. The design document is converted into code.
4. **Testing**: After the implementation phase, the developed software is tested against the requirements.
5. **Deployment**: Once the software passes the testing phase, it is deployed in the real world environment.
6. **Maintenance**: After deployment, the software undergoes maintenance to correct any bugs, add new features

### Useful models that can be used 
There are various models of SDLC that are followed during the software development process. Some of the popular ones include the Waterfall model, Agile model, Lean model, V-Shaped model, Big Bang model, and others...
